you could make some kind of hotkey system to activate buttons. so that way, if you ever need to use this with a bigger monitor,
you can just focus on the window and press hotkeys to do it`

current connection tab (figure out if you can detect wired)

enable/disable wifi button have the button toggle between "enabled" and "disabled" when you're futzing around with it
nmcli --terse --get-values bssid,ssid device wifi list

for actually worrying about passwords, prompt for a password and then if the user leaves it blank, run the 
version of the command that doesn't use the password at all

have some way of alternate coloring the line information when you scan

g++ main.cpp ./functionality/scan.cpp ./functionality/run.cpp -o a.out -lfltk

button to forget network 

have talise password written down on a peice of paper so I can fuck with stuff, though make sure to not 
upload to github

// these will be used just about everywhere in all of my funcitons
get_MAC_from_line(line) {
    return start pos of mac addr
    return end pos of mac addr
    return contents of mac addr (without slashes)
    return escape_included
}

get_network_name_from_line(line) {
    return start/end pos
    return if contents exists
    return contetns 
}

also at some point you're going to want to have a windows/mobile/etc switch for compiling shit, where you define
the commands dynamically
