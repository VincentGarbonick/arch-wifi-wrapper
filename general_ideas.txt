nmcli --terse connection show --active (could be a way to show current device connected) (maybe I can just use one of the args that only outputs the name) 
	- figure out case when it has no name 
	- figure out case when it is wired connection 


box for current connection status (have it refresh each time we run a command)
box for general status (have it refresh each time we push a button)
button to forget current connection 
button to enable/disable wifi
button to connect, obviously
some kind of global variable that stores current connection, so we don't have to make seperate calls when we initialize it?
nmcli --terse connection delete [uuid, etc]

Starting loop: 
check if wifi is enabled/disabled (if disabled, populate status bar and have button label reflect that)
check if we have an active connection (if yes, put in global variable and populate status bar, if no, populate status bar)

Buttons 
-------------------------------
Scan for networks 
Connect to selected 
forget current (have an "are you sure?" window)

enable/disable 

boxes 
--------------------
scan results 
current connection
status bar(first thing it says on startup should be "enabled/disabled") (make this scrollable?)
